# Data-Science-Interview-QA-Hub

I initiated a series featuring data science interview questions, which will cover different categories but for for now i am preparing Data Science Questions and Answers which are compiled in this GitHub repository for easy access. Questions are curated by me and are welcomed if anyone can share their experience with me which can help others to prepare . Feel free to send additional questions or improve my answers via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akanksha-d-7b37a47b/) or email at 1akankshadash@gmail.com. The objective is to strengthen fundamental data science skills, simplify interview preparation, and acquaint individuals with anticipated questions.
